> ZJU Advanced C (C大程) course project, a billiard game based on libgraphcis
 
I think my work a **PIECE OF SHIT**.

The overall project structure is listed as following: 

```
├─Custom Code
│  ├─Header
│  └─Source
├─Default
└─Project
    ├─About
    ├─Data
    ├─Music
```

`Custom Code` contains the our code, `Default` contains the graphics library provided by the course. `Project` is a **VS** project, consider to use `Custom Code`, `Default`, `About`, `Data`, `Music` to rebuild your own project.
